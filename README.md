## Origins
This dual token elastic money suppply protocol is an experiment to create a truly *good* money, a money owned by the people, not by governments.

We took inspiration from [Robert Sam's seigniorage shares paper](https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf) and created a stable money that bifurcates speculators and regular users.

In this way, we preserve the stablecoin price AND the purchasing power of the wallet.

We will get a respected 3rd party security firm to audit the code. The protocol will then be launched on Uniswap and other exchanges.
